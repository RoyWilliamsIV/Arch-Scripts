# Arch Install T60
---
## A simple install bash script for my Thinkpad T60.

###The region is set to America/Chicago, and the keyboard layout is en_US.UTF-8.

It creates three partitions.

1. Small BIOS partition for Grub
2. Swap Space
3. The remainder of the drive as an ext4 (root partition)

The script installs grub and intel-ucode drivers after finishing.
